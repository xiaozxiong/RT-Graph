# RT or Not: Can We Accelerate Graph Algorithms with Ray Tracing Cores?

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- CUDA 11.8
- OptiX 7.5
- gcc 11

### Build

Download OptiX7.5 SDK from [NVIDIA OptiXâ„¢ Legacy Downloads](https://developer.nvidia.com/designworks/optix/downloads/legacy) and set an enviromental variable `OptiX_INSTALL_DIR` which refers to the include directory of OptiX.
```bash
export OptiX_INSTALL_DIR=/home/xzx/OptiX7.5/include
```
Then you can enter a diretory (e.g., bfs) and run the following commands:
```shell
cmake -B build
cd build
make -j
```

Most datasets can be found in [SuiteSparse Matrix Collection](https://sparse.tamu.edu/), we use the matrix market (.mtx) format for our program. Dataset `soc-orkut` and `soc-twitter-2010` are downloaded from [Network Repository](https://networkrepository.com/networks.php).

Note: All datasets are placed in a directory named `dataset`.

All datasets can be downloaded from [Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/). And for synthesised datasets, we use [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) to generate graphs following power law which can be found in `tc/script/powerlaw_graph.py`.
